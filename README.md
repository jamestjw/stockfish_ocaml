# Stockfish

This is a complete rewrite of [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) in OCaml. The objective of this rewrite is to see how well does a functional language lend itself to the development of a chess engine. I tried my best to employ only functional paradigms whenever possible. The rewrite was also done with the hopes that it will strengthen my understanding of one of the best modern chess engines.


## Files
This distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:

* `README.md`, the file you are currently reading.

## Terms of use
Stockfish is free and distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL v3). Essentially, this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program, including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some way, you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must also be made available under GPL v3.
